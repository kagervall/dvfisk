## Swedish Electrofishing Register (SERS)

R API:s available for SERS: **SersAggregerad** (beta) and **SersVix** (beta).

SersAggregerad gives you aggregated data for all years a site has been fished. SersVix returns of the data for
individual sites for each year fished with estimates for the density of all species caught and lots of information
about the site and the fishing.

Information about Swedish Electrofishing Register (SERS) is available at <https://www.slu.se/en/departments/aquatic-resources1/databases/database-for-testfishing-in-streams/>

## Database for Survey test-fishing (NORS)

The data in NORS is quality assured test-fishing data generated in national and regional environmental programs.
NORS contains data from standardized test-fishing with Nordic multi-mesh gillnets
that investigate the fish fauna in a lake. The nets, consisting of 12 mesh sizes, catch most of the Swedish species
in a representative way, giving a good estimate of species abundance and size distribution. in thousands of lakes.
The database is in Swedish.

R API:s available for KUL: **NorsAggregerad** (beta), **NorsFangst** (beta) and **NorsIndivid** (beta).

## Database for Coastal Fish (KUL)

The KUL database contains catch data from the coastal fishery. In its current form, KUL has been in operation since 2006. Individual fish data are also stored in KUL. This can be gender distribution or information on the length, weight or age of individual fish. 

R API:s available for KUL: **KulFangst** (beta), **KulIndivid** (beta) and **KulLangd** (beta).
